# Hey there, I'm Aman! 👋

I’m a **second-year Master’s student in Software Engineering & IoT at Ynov**. I have a strong foundation in low-level development and a growing interest in Web3 technologies. I completed my **Bachelor's degree at EPITECH**, where I gained hands-on experience working on a variety of challenging projects.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> I am currently seeking a **part-time apprenticeship** starting from **September 2025** as part of my end-of-studies program. My ideal role would be in one of the following areas:
> - Embedded software/IoT
> - desktop software development

I'm particularly interested in opportunities that allow me to apply my skills in a real-world setting, contribute to meaningful projects, and potentially transition into a full-time role after completing my studies.
